# Executive Sales Analysis Dashboard (Excel & Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project analyses sales performance, product contribution, discount strategies, and regional profitability using Excel and Power BI. The objective is to transform raw transactional data into executive-level insights that support pricing optimisation, margin protection, and strategic decision-making.

## Key Business Questions
- How has sales performance evolved over time?
- Which product categories and products drive the majority of revenue?
- Are discount strategies translating into sustainable profits?
- Which regions present profitability and margin risk?

## Dashboard Insights

### Sales Trend Analysis
Sales showed steady growth through 2024 before declining in 2025, indicating a potential demand slowdown or pricing sensitivity that requires further investigation.

### Category & Product Contribution
Revenue is heavily concentrated in Home Decor, Furniture, and Clothing. A small group of products contributes a disproportionate share of total revenue, highlighting dependency on key performers.

### Discount vs Profit Analysis
Higher discounts do not consistently lead to higher profits. Products with controlled discounting tend to cluster higher on the profit axis, suggesting aggressive discounting erodes margins rather than driving sustainable growth.

### Regional Profitability & Risk
Some regions rely on heavy discounting to drive sales but generate comparatively lower profit, indicating margin erosion risk and the need for region-specific pricing review.

## Tools Used

### Excel (Data Cleaning & Preparation)
- Validated and removed duplicate records
- Standardised date formats for time-series analysis
- Corrected data types (numeric, currency, percentage)
- Created calculated columns (Sales, Profit, Profit Margin)
- Built pivot tables to validate trends and category performance
- Structured clean, analysis-ready tables for BI ingestion

### Power BI (Analysis & Visualisation)
- Imported and validated data using Power Query
- Enforced data type integrity and column consistency
- Built interactive visuals:
  - Sales trend over time
  - Revenue contribution by category
  - Top 10 products by revenue
  - Discount vs Profit scatter analysis
  - Regional profitability heatmap
- Applied correct aggregation logic (Sum, Average)
- Implemented slicers (Category, Year) for dynamic exploration
- Delivered executive-level data storytelling with business recommendations

## Outcome
This dashboard enables stakeholders to identify growth risks, optimise discount strategies, prioritise high-performing products, and address regional margin erosion through data-driven decision-making.
