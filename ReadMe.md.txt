# Executive Sales Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project analyses sales performance, product contribution, discount strategies, and regional profitability using Excel and Power BI. The goal is to transform raw transactional data into actionable insights that support pricing optimisation, margin protection, and regional performance decisions.

## Key Business Questions
- How has sales performance evolved over time?
- Which product categories and products drive revenue?
- Are discounts translating into sustainable profits?
- Which regions present profitability and margin risk?

## Data Preparation (Excel)
Excel was used extensively to prepare the dataset before BI ingestion:
- Validated and removed duplicate records to ensure data accuracy
- Standardised date formats to enable time-series analysis
- Fixed numeric inconsistencies and enforced correct data types
- Created calculated columns for sales, profit, and discount metrics
- Built initial pivot tables to validate trends and totals before Power BI
- Structured the dataset into clean, analysis-ready tables

## Data Transformation (Power Query)
Power Query was used to:
- Enforce correct data types (dates, numeric measures, text fields)
- Validate column integrity and remove errors
- Prepare a clean semantic layer for reporting and modelling

## Dashboard Insights
### Sales Trend
Sales increased steadily through 2024 but declined in 2025, indicating a potential demand slowdown or pricing sensitivity that requires investigation.

### Category & Product Performance
Revenue is concentrated in Home Decor, Furniture, and Clothing, with a small group of products driving a disproportionate share of total sales.

### Discount vs Profit Analysis
Higher discounts do not consistently lead to higher profits. Products with controlled discount strategies cluster higher on the profit axis, highlighting margin erosion risks from aggressive discounting.

### Regional Profitability
Some regions rely heavily on discounting to drive sales yet generate comparatively lower profit, signalling pricing and margin risk.

## Tools Used
- **Excel**: data cleaning, duplicate validation, formatting, calculated columns, pivot tables
- **Power Query**: data transformation, validation, type enforcement
- **Power BI**: data modelling, interactive dashboards, slicers, and visual analytics

## Outcome
The dashboard enables stakeholders to identify revenue concentration risk, optimise discount strategies, and prioritise high-performing products and regions using data-driven insights.
